## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
Refers to specific screen widths or device sizes where the layout and styling of a website are adjusted to provide an optimal user experience and adapts to the screen size.


- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
Percentage-based widths allow the columns to scale proportionally with the screen size. Using percentage-based widths can simplify maintenance because you don't need to set different fixed widths for each breakpoint.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
The CSS rules for the smaller min-width will "win" due to the nature of cascading and specificity in CSS and the code being lower on the page takes precedence.

- What is JSX?
  JSX stands for "JavaScript XML." It's a syntax extension for JavaScript often used with libraries like React for building user interfaces. JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within their JavaScript code. This makes it easier to describe how the UI should look and behave.

- How does React use JSX to render components?
  React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, to define the structure of UI components in a declarative manner, which is then transformed into React element function calls, enabling efficient rendering and updating of the user interface.

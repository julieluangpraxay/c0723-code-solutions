## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of variables?

A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store data.

- How do you **declare** a variable?

Let is assigned when you want to change the variable name more than once and const is assigned when you want the variable to remain constant/the same and it doesn't change.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?

You assign it to a value
ex: let variableName = value;

- What characters are allowed in variable names?

The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and \_.
The first character must not be a digit.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?

There will be an error if the case is wrong. It must be lowercased or uppercased depending on the name of the code.

- What is the purpose of a string?
  a string is a data type used to represent a sequence of characters.
  storing and manipulating text, displaying dynamic content, intereacting with user input, working with APIs, string manipulation and transformation, comparison and searching.

- What is the purpose of a number?

mathmatical operations, data storage and manipulation, conditional statements and comparisons, iteration and counting, radomization and probability, working with dates and time, interacting with API and external data.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?

The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.

1. conditional statements
2. comparison and logical operations
3. flagging and toggling
4. function returns
5. loop termination conditions
6. program logic and decision-making

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?

the = operator is an assignment operator and used to assign a value or a variable or property.

- How do you update the value of a variable?

you just change the variable name
example:
let never;
never = julie;

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

Null is a value that represents intentional absence of any object value and undefined is a value that indicates the absense of a defined value. Undefined is typically used whe a variable is decalred but has not been assigned a value.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?

  To stay organized with the code

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.

1. numbers
2. booleans
3. string
4. null
5. undefined

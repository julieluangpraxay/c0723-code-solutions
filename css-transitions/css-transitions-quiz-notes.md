## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- The `transition` property is shorthand for which four CSS properties?
  It is for specifying how a CSS property should transition from one value to another when a change occurs.

  For example:
  transition-property: Specifies the CSS properties that are being transitioned. You can specify one or multiple properties separated by commas.

transition-duration: Specifies the duration of the transition animation. It's typically defined in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).

transition-timing-function: Defines the timing function that determines the pace of the transition. It controls the acceleration and deceleration of the animation. Common values include "ease," "linear," "ease-in," "ease-out," and "ease-in-out."

transition-delay: Specifies a delay before the transition starts. This can be helpful for creating staggered or timed animations.

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?

By stacking vertically, expanding width-wise, creating line breaks, and participating in the CSS box model. They provide a natural flow for content, ensuring readability and allowing for positioning and alignment within their parent container.

A block-level element is an HTML element that takes up horizontal space by default. It stretches 100% wide and takes on the height of its inner content.

## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is Webpack?
  Webpack is a free and open-source module bundler for JavaScript. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

- What is the advantage of using Webpack (or a similar bundler)?
  Webpack is a static module bundler for JavaScript applications â€” it takes all the code from your application and makes it usable in a web browser. Modules are reusable chunks of code built from your app's JavaScript, node_modules, images, and the CSS styles which are packaged to be easily used in your website.

- What is Babel?
  A popular open-source JavaScript compiler that is used to convert code written in newer versions of JavaScript (such as ES6/ES2015 and beyond) into versions that are compatible with older browsers and environments.

- What is the advantage of using Babel (or a similar transpiler)?
  Using Babel or a similar transpiler allows developers to write code using the latest language features while ensuring compatibility with older environments and browsers.

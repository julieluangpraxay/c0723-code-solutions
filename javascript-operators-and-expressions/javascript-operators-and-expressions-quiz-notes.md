## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What data type is returned by an arithmetic operation?
  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, division, concatenation
- What is string concatenation?
  when you add two strings together with a + operator.
- What purpose(s) does the `+` plus operator serve in JavaScript?
  it combines data
- What data type is returned by comparing two values (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc)?
  true or false/ boolean
- What does the `+=` "plus-equals" operator do?
  It adds the value of the right-hand side operand to the value of the left-hand side operand.
  It assigns the result back to the left-hand side operand.
  example:
  let num = 5;
  num += 3;
  console.log(num); // Output: 8
  In this example, the initial value of num is 5. The line num += 3; adds 3 to the current value of num using the += operator. It is equivalent to writing num = num + 3;. The result of the addition, 8, is then assigned back to the num variable.

After executing this code, the value of num will be 8, which is logged to the console using console.log(num);.

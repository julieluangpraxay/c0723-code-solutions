## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  The purpose of a loop is to repeat a set of instructions multiple times.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The purpose of a condition expression in a loop is to determine whether the loop should continue or terminate.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  In the context of loops, "iteration" refers to each individual execution of the loop's body.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression of a while loop gets evaluated before each iteration of the loop.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The initialization expression of a for loop gets evaluated before the loop starts executing.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression of a for loop gets evaluated before each iteration of the loop.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression of a for loop gets evaluated at the end of each iteration, after the loop's body is executed

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  Besides a return statement, the break keyword exits a loop before its condition expression evaluates to false.
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The ++ increment operator is used to increase the value of a variable by 1.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  To iterate through the keys of an object, you can use a for...in loop. For each iteration, the loop variable will represent a key of the object.

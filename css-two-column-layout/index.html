          <h2>Mario</h2>
          <p>
            Mario is a fictional character in the Mario video game franchise,
            owned by Nintendo and created by Japanese video game designer
            Shigeru Mivamoto. Acting as the company's mascot, as well as being
            the eponymous protagonist of the series, Mario has appeared in over
            200 video games since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy,
            Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures
            generally center upon rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain
            Bowser.

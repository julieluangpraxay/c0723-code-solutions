## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  a function is a block of code that is designed to perform a specific task or calculate a value
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  function: The keyword used to declare a function.
  functionName: The name of the function (optional). It is used to reference the function later when calling it.
  parameter1, parameter2, ...: The parameters (also called arguments) are variables that represent values passed into the function. They are optional, and you can have zero or more parameters.
  { ... }: The code block contains the statements or actions to be executed when the function is called. It is enclosed in curly braces {}.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  function def has parameters, function calls have arguments that replace the parameters
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  they allow you to pass data into a function, enabling the function to work with different values or perform specific tasks based on the provided inputs.

  produces a value when you call the function and stops the excution of code.

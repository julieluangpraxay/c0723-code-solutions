## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are objects used for?
  In contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language.
- What are object properties?
  Object properties are the characteristics or attributes associated with an object in JavaScript. They define the state, behavior, and characteristics of the object and consist of key-value pairs.
  variables with an object
- Describe object literal notation.
  Object literal notation allows you to define multiple properties and their values within a single expression, making it a convenient way to create objects on the fly. It is commonly used when you need to create simple objects with static properties and methods without the need for a complex class structure.
  example:
  const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true,
  greet: function() {
  console.log('Hello!');
  }
  };

- How do you remove a property from an object?
  delete object.property
  delete object[property]
- What are the two ways to get or update the value of a property?
  Dot notation: Dot notation is used to access and update the value of a property directly using the dot (.) operator
  Bracket notation: Bracket notation allows you to access and update the value of a property using square brackets ([]). This notation is especially useful when the property name needs to be dynamic or is not a valid identifier.
